# Pop Punked Up README

## About
Pop Punked up is a database cataloguing pop punk covers of mainstream pop songs. It is a Rails 4.2 App and is still under development. 

## Setup
Feel free to clone and `bundle install` if you are so inclined. So far, only partial CRUD actions for the admin are implemented, but you can either browse through their implementation in localhost or peruse the integration test suite by running RSpec files in the `spec/features` directory.
